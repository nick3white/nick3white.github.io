## Work History

### Newberry Library

- Built and rebuilt 10+ projects as the principal developer, focusing on replicating the wonderful aspects of traditional library and learning experiences, while still providing novel, innovative experiences.
- Provided the back end support, through scripting (python & bash) and heavy lifting, for a major DAMS upgrade project, gathering, transforming, manipulating, and massaging millions of records coming from various decaying sources, with an emphasis on reusability - the next DAMS upgrade will be much easier.
- Maintained the web infrastructure for decades of the Newberry's Digital Initiatives, from server migrations, database administration, and branding overhauls to old projects, to cron jobs to update my Slack status based on time of day.  In the last year, I've been transforming the library's digital infrastructure to a cloud-first model; I believe that approach outsources the library's most problematic points of weakness.

### Chicago Public Library 

- Built bespoke tools for reference librarians to enable them to search and discover their passion projects in order to share the resources, and their passions, with patrons
- Managed large scale digitization projects from conception to launch, including the grant writing, staffing, and planning in between
- Created web portals for digital content, from digital collections, to born-digital gifts to the Special Collections, with an emphasis on building rock solid tools that would survive without maintenance, using Ruby and Jekyll SSG tools

### Freelance Web Development

- Pretty standard freelance web dev: built sites for clients, or updated existing ones; some projects were 10 year old behemoths for which I just used PHP and CSS, while others were new creations, for which I used everything from Django to Angular (which was new at the time!) 

### Codifyd

- Handled data remediation, transformation, and restructuring for large scale projects, delivering millions of cleaned records yearly
- Consulted nationally and internationally on data science, data architecture, and how to both communicate data, and to listen to it
- Worked with clients with millions of products and thousands of employees, as well as with companies small scale companies (which were usually more fun!)

## Interests
*What drives my growth and direction*

### Technology
- **Qwik** JS has got me thinking about how (and when!) I deliver JS to the client; while it may not make a difference to efficiency (depending on the bundle), but it helps to keep from getting too abstract in my thinking.
- I've been making websites since they were just HTML, so playing with **HTMX** reminds me of that era.  JavaScript makes it feel like everything is imaginary except JS; HTMX reminds me of the before times.
- Playing around with **Lit** - and working with web components generally - feels like you're Gambit from the X-Men.  I love their versatility - though, to be honest, I haven't found a great use case in my work.

### Non-Technology
- I'm always excited to have conversations about **music**.  I have pretty wide tastes, from 50s jazz, 60s experimental music, 70s dub, 80s hardcore, 90s indie, 00s IDM, to Simpsonwave in the 2010s, there's always something interesting going on.
- **Arts & Literature** may seem like they're far afield, but they inform the foundations of my approaches.  Non-representational Theory (Gilles Deleuze, Guy Debord) and phenomenology (Maurice Blanchot, Alphonso Lingis) are a couple of specific areas of interest.
