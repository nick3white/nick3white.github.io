# Nick 3 White

Just a simple resume website. I can't help but give it a little flash, but I think I managed to keep it tasteful. Some day I will have free time, at which point I'll finish the several other css themes I had in mind: vaporwave (a lighter, airier take on the synthwave theme), floral (who doesn't like flowers), BASIC (who doesn't love 1980s tech aesthetics), and basic (I wanted to try my hand at a super boring, Microsoft Word Resume Template style).

I could just copypaste the resume here, but that seems silly. Take a look [at the built version](https://nick3white.github.io/)!

Built using Qwik, because why not!
